# Q3 Pet hospital

A pet owner can register at a pet hospital and arrange for an appointment with a vet to see one or more of his pets. At the end of each appointment, the vet will record down the outcome of the appointment - what medicine is prescribed and what is the diagnosis and also the details of the pet -- its breed, name and owner. The system also records down what medicine a pet is taking at the moment. 

During a workday, a vet may see more than one pet. The hospital itself hires 5 vets and they work different day or night shifts.

The hospital must know the address as to where to send the bill. Each appointment will be billed separately.
