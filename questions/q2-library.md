## Q2 Library Question

A user can be a member of a library. He can borrow up to 4 books, and the due date is 2 weeks from the current date. If the book is overdue, the member must pay a fine, which is 10 cent per day. A user can search for a book by title, author or publisher -- a book can be written by many authors and be published by different publisher. Finally, a member can also reserve up to 1 book at a time. 

Assume: There's only one copy of each book.

Advanced: What if there are multiple copies of a book?

Advanced 2: What if there are multiple editions of a book?
